# Basic_Calculator
**Basic calculator** project using Python and GUI using Tkinter.</br>
In 1642, the first true **“calculator”** was invented, one that performed calculations through a clockwork-type of mechanism called The **Pascal calculator** which was lauded for attempting arithmetic calculations previously thought impossible.</br>
An **Electronic** calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.

### General Info
* A calculator is used for perfoming **Arthmetic Operations** on real numbers. A calculator is capable of perfoming many operations which are difficult to be done, it is done in a very short amount of time based on the inputs given.
* A basic calculator is limited to performing basic **arthemetic operations** such as 
     * Addition ('+') 
     * Subtraction ('-')
     * Multiplication ('*')
     * Division ('/')
* The **general layout** of a Basic Calculator is 
     * Clear (C) to clear the input number/numbers
     * clear entry (CE) to clear the recent entry number
     * Numbers ranging from [0-9]
     * The basic arthmetic operations ( '+' '-' '*' '/' )
     * '.' is used to separate the whole number part from the fractional part of a number.
     * '=' is used to perform the operation 
     * A display to show the output of the arithmetic operation.
### Input format
* The input format for the basic calculator is infix represntation that is -- number **operator** number 
### More Info
* To be able to run this python program make sure that the latest version of python is installed in PC/Laptop (Windows/Linux/Mac)
* Follow the instructions in setup
### Calculator
* Run the python code in your command prompt / terminal and enter the input
* You are asked for input of (1/2/3/4) for basic operations and Enter True/False for Floating point numbers
